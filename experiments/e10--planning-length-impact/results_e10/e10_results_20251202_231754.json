    "reasoning": "All three plans satisfy the basic requirement: call the Asana-enabled capability to list all tasks in the configured project with name and completion status, and avoid mutating data. The differences lie in test-data setup constraints, handling of pre-existing data, and determinism of verification.\n\n1) HIGH (best)\n- Completeness: Explicitly constrains the project to have exactly three tasks and forbids any others. This allows deterministic verification that the agent truly listed *all* tasks and did not skip or filter anything. It also explicitly ensures read-only behavior and includes a negative requirement for GitHub (no cross-service side effects).\n- Quality: Very strong: it defines concrete task names, completion states, and requires notes to be non-empty, ensuring the tasks are clearly recognizable. By forcing the project to contain only those three tasks, the test detects agents that only list partial results, or that mis-handle pagination, because any discrepancy becomes obvious.\n- Feasibility: Entirely feasible in a controlled test environment where we are allowed to delete/ensure absence of other tasks in the project. The instructions for the GitHub service are simple and purely observational.\n- Edge Cases: Covers the edge case of unintended side effects (no new tasks, no modifications, no GitHub activity). It does not directly exercise the \u201cno tasks in project\u201d scenario, but ensures strong validation for correct listing and read-only behavior, which is more important for this core task.\n- Clarity: Very clear, well-structured, and unambiguous about project identity, number of tasks, and verification expectations.\n\n2) MEDIUM\n- Completeness: Also calls for listing all tasks with name and completion status and checking that no mutations occur. It respects the requirement to handle empty-project scenarios, though the specific test data it provisions ensures there are at least three tasks.\n- Quality: Good but weaker than HIGH. It permits pre-existing tasks to remain and does not limit the project to only the three created tasks. This means that verification is less strict: the validator only needs to see that the three specific tasks with correct statuses exist, but cannot easily assert that the agent listed *every* task in the project. As a result, an agent that lists only some tasks could still pass if it happens to include these three.\n- Feasibility: Very feasible\u2014does not require cleaning existing data, just appends three tasks. This is friendly to shared environments but compromises determinism.\n- Edge Cases: Allows additional tasks and doesn\u2019t verify behavior in a fully empty project. It also does not probe pagination or maximum result size, though it\u2019s still sufficient for a baseline test.\n- Clarity: Clear instructions, but less strict language about project contents makes the test less powerful.\n\n3) MINIMAL (worst)\n- Completeness: Meets the basic goal of read-only listing but is more brittle. It additionally constrains that there must be *no other tasks whose names start with* a specific prefix and requires exactly three such tasks. However, it does *not* restrict the total number of tasks in the project, only those with that prefix.\n- Quality: Weaker and more idiosyncratic than MEDIUM and HIGH. The focus on a name prefix rather than the whole project content complicates the mental model and validation. There could be many other tasks in the project, and the test then mainly confirms listing of these three specially named tasks. As with MEDIUM, an under-listing agent might still pass if it happens to return just these tasks.\n- Feasibility: Potentially more intrusive than MEDIUM because it may require deleting or renaming pre-existing tasks that share the prefix, which could be more disruptive in a shared environment than simply adding new uniquely named tasks.\n- Edge Cases: Like MEDIUM, it does not meaningfully probe the \u201cno tasks at all\u201d path in practice, since it deliberately creates tasks. Its special treatment of the name prefix is an unnecessary complexity and does not improve edge-case coverage.\n- Clarity: Somewhat less clear due to the prefix-based constraint and the requirement to manipulate or rename pre-existing tasks with that prefix; this introduces ambiguity and extra steps without clear benefit.\n\nOverall ranking based on the combined criteria and higher reasoning effort level is: HIGH as 1st, MEDIUM as 2nd, MINIMAL as 3rd.",

    "worst_plan_weaknesses": "Relies on a name-prefix convention rather than total project contents, which complicates validation; does not ensure that *all* tasks are verifiably listed, only that three specially named tasks exist and are unmodified; may require deleting or renaming pre-existing tasks that share the prefix, which is more intrusive and less feasible in shared environments; and adds complexity without improving coverage of edge cases such as empty projects or pagination."
