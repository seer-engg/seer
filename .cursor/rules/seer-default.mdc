# Project Instructions

## General
- DO THINGS THAT DON'T SCALE.
- KICKASS HALF-ASS IS BETTER THAN A HALF-ASS FULL.
- THINK BEFORE YOU CODE.
- IF A TOOL CALL IS UPDATING THE STATE VIA COMMAND, IT MUST APPEND A TOOLMESSAGE WITH THE TOOL_CALL_ID TO THE MESSAGES LIST
- Propose a plan first before writing any code.
- Creative destruction is key. Code bloating is guaranteed - you'll often need to delete code you wrote.
- Regularly check if a part of the code is aligned with rest of the code.
- Don't generate .md files including summary of changes, improvements, etc. Summarize and present to user instead.
- When you realize you're wrong, point your mistakes and nudge the user to update `.cursor/rules/seer-default.mdc` file.

## On Code Structure
- Keep agents (eval, codex) as separate as possible. Each should be in their own folder.

## On LangChain Agents
- Build agents using LangChain. 
- Langchain 'graph' in 'graph.py' kinda files includes a custom checkpointer i.e. it saves the state of the agent. So, don't need to write your own checkpointer.
- Langchain supports inter agent communication out of the box. Assistant and Thread IDs must be hexadecimal UUIDs, NOT string names!
- Langchain documentation is outdated on the internet. Before using any online documentation, check if its the latest version.

## Seer Philosophy
- Seer is a network of agents using inter agent communication (not broadcast)
- Separation of concerns within agents is a great agentic AI design principle
- Hence, multi agents systems (MAS) are inevitable - they offer modularization and greater abstraction than monolithic code
- If MAS are inevitable, tracing agent conversations, handoff, etc is required
- Testing without software update is useful in some scenarios
- Humans are bad at writing a comprehensive eval all at once i.e. it comes in bits and pieces
- Self-eval OR self-code review is hard i.e. code generation and evaluation must be separate
