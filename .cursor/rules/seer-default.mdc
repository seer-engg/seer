# Seer Architecture

## API
- We have a FastAPI-based client in the /api directory.
- It has built-in auth middlewares in /middleware/auth that inject a database_user "db_user" object into request.state. Throughout the APIs, we should use this for user-related operations.

## Database

- We use a PostgreSQL database via the tortoise-orm[asyncpg] interface.
- Do not create SQL migration files in the /migrations directory for database model schema changes i will do migrations myself.
- all database model should reside in /shared/database 

## Worlflows

### Overview
- The core logic for workflow components, building, compilation is in /workflow_core
- /api/workflow contains CRUD and chat agent apis for workflows
- /agent/workflow_agent conatains a langgraph based agent that can build workflow via natural language query.
